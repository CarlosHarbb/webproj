<p>A total of 4.68 million cellular mobile connections were active in Lebanon in early 2025, with this figure equivalent to 80.4 percent of the total population.<br>
     However, note that some of these connections may only include services such as voice and SMS, and some may not include access to the internet.<br>
There were 5.34 million individuals using the internet in Lebanon at the start of 2025, when online penetration stood at 91.6 percent.Lebanon was home to 4.02 million social media user identities in January 2025, equating to 68.9 percent of the total population.<br> Ookla’s data reveals that the median mobile internet connection speed in Lebanon increased by 7.10 Mbps (+33.3 percent) in the twelve months to the start of 2023.

Meanwhile, Ookla’s data shows that fixed internet connection speeds in Lebanon decreased by 0.40 Mbps (-5.2 percent) during the same period.<br> The number of Internet users in the Middle East region accounted for approximately 348 million, which represents 70.2% of the total population of 496 million, according to a study conducted by Galal and Karawi Management Consulting</p>
