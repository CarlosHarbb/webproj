<p>The World Wide Web WWW refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their devices (desktops, laptops, mobiles...) through the internet. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working at CERN in 1989. He disliked how hard it was to search for information so he proposed a "universal linked information system" using a lot of concepts and technologies, the most fundamental of which was the connections that existed between information</p>
<p> A Web browser is an application for accessing websites which can be used on a range of devices (eg: mobile phones and desktops) most popular examples include chrome, microsoft edge, opera... while chrome remains the most popular browser remains, every other browser presents its own set of benefits that attracts a lot of users.</p>
