<h2>Meaning and importance</h2>
<p>The Mobile-First concept is crucial because it prioritizes the user experience on mobile devices, which are now the most popular way to access the Internet.<br>Designing for mobile-first ensures that your products are optimized for the majority of users, as most internet traffic today comes from smartphones and tablets.

Mobile devices have small screens and touch interfaces, which can significantly impact the user's experience.<br> By focusing on mobile design first, you ensure that your website or app is intuitive and user-friendly. This approach guarantees that users can easily navigate and interact with your site, no matter the device they are using. In turn, this leads to better user engagement, increased website traffic, and a more successful overall design.<br>The main reason for applying the mobile first concept is the sheer amount of mobile users that outnumber the desktop ones (63% to 37%) so it makes more sense to give the mobile users a smooth and complete experience. </p>
