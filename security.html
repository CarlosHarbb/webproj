      <h2>Evolution of Web Security</h2>
      <p>Web security used to not be a priority in the early days of the web since sites were simple and were not a worthy target for the attackers. However after sensitive data started being handled on the Web (banking, healthcare ,communication) security has begun to take a high priority.The Cybersecurity checking began in the 1970s when researcher Bob Thomas created a computer program called Creeper that could move across ARPANET’s network. Ray Tomlinson, the innovator of email, wrote the program Reaper, which chased and deleted Creepers. Reaper was the very first example of checking a malware antivirus software and the first self-replicating program i.e. Viruses, as it made first-ever computer worms and trojans. In the early 2000s criminal organizations started to heavily fund professional cyberattacks and governments began to clamp down on the criminality of hackings, giving much money serious sentences to those culpable hackers and Information security continues to advance as the internet grows as well but, unfortunately so having the viruses.  Cyber-attacks cost the global economy an estimated $8 trillion annually in 2023 and are expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually in 2025. It is important for companies to invest in cybersecurity to protect their data and maintain their userbase.

        <p>Attackers constantly imrprove their tools to bypass the current best security protocols that is why even the best cybestsecurity strategy can't eliminate all the risk, which is why cybersecurity should always keep evolving and multilayered security is a must.</p>
